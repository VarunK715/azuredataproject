üöÄ From On-Premises to Azure: My Data Migration Journey üåê

Overview
In this project, I migrated data from an on-premises SQL Server to Azure using various Azure services. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process.

1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
Setup:
Self-Hosted Integration Runtime: Configured to connect ADF to the on-premises SQL Server.

Data Extraction:
Extracted Raw Data: Retrieved data from the SQL Server.

Data Retrieval:
Lookup Activity: Used to fetch table names.

For Each Activity: Iterated through all tables.

Parameterization:
Parameterized Datasets: Avoided manual entry by using parameters for table names and schema names.

Scheduling:
Scheduled Triggers: Ensured efficient pipeline execution.

Data Loading:
Loaded Data into ADLS Gen2: Data was saved in Parquet format.

2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
Medallion Architecture:
Implemented to organize and manage data through different layers.

Data Segmentation:
Bronze Layer: Raw data ingested from the on-premises SQL Server.

Silver Layer: Transformed raw data.

Gold Layer: Curated, aggregated, and transformed data.

4. Databricks Community Edition
   
Data Transformation:
Column Renaming: Standardized column names.

Date Formatting: Formatted dates for consistency.

Data Output:
Transformed Data: Data was converted to Delta format and saved back to ADLS Gen2.

4. Azure Key Vault
Credential Management:
Stored Credentials: Securely stored SQL Server credentials (username and password).

Integration with ADF: Utilized stored credentials in ADF for linked services.
